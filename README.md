# MyBB-pkg-minor-tweaks

Just some minor tweaks done quickly back in 2016
due to constantly being on a mobile localhost and opting to want to tweak the install and documentation for such at the time..
as I was then tinkering with from 1808 to 1812 (example: https://github.com/vintagedaddyo/MyBB_Core-mybb_1812_responsive) a respo by default 
project due to the common frustrations found by many in the core being not up with the times and respo already (* one: did it for my own personal usages. two: did it to prove a point on how easily and quickly it could be done. three: did it to prove a point that contrary to some claims we did not need a complete core rewrite to offer our userbase a more up to the times distro pkg. Four: stopped project after proving intended points and also stopped project because I stopped using mybb for the most part due to already mentioned factors except for say short usages when providing support for existing contributions
